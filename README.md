# Eloquent JavaScript Exercises With Answers - FOURTH EDITION 🎉

Welcome to the repository where I solve the exercises from the book https://eloquentjavascript.net/ by Marijn Haverbeke. This book is a great resource for learning JavaScript, and I have included my solutions to the exercises at the end of each chapter.

## Project Structure 📂

- Each chapter's exercises are contained in their own `.js` file.
- The file names are in the format `chapter<number>_exercise.js`.

## How to Run the Code 🚀

To run the JavaScript files and see the output in your console, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    bash
    git clone https://github.com/itsmuskanagarwal/eloquentJavaScriptExercisesWithAnswers.git
    cd eloquentJavaScriptExercisesWithAnswers
    

2. **Navigate to the desired chapter**:
    bash
    cd chapter<number>
    

3. **Run the JavaScript file**:
    - Using Node.js:
        bash
        node chapter<number>_exercise.js
        

    - Alternatively, you can run the files in a browser console by opening the `.js` file and pasting the code into the browser's developer tools console.
